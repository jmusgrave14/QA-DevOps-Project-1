# QA-DevOps-Project-1

## Objective

The objective for this phase 2 of the DevOps training project was to create a fully automated CI pipeline, based around the program created during project 1. 

This would involve using the tools learned since completing Project 1: Docker, Jenkins and Nexus. 


## Planning, Design and Project Tracking 

### Trello

I used Trello as my project management tool to keep track of the different tasks and divide them into To Do, Doing and Done

### ERD

This basic Entity Relationship Diagram plans out the database used for the project

### Risk Assessment 

This is a basic initial risk assessment. As this was a training project the risks involved were low

## Implementation

### Docker 

Firstly I created a new Dockerfile in my Project 1 folder

I then used this to build and run a Docker image of my Project 1 app

Finally I connected this image to the database I had created on MySQLWorkbench

### Nexus 

I was not very confident using Nexus due to difficulties with the teaching of it. However I followed instructions to sign in and create proxy and hosted repositiories
